Playing with Rust - FizzBuzz Kata

Typically, I didn't think about committing properly when doing the TDD, so there are no exciting (an interesting term with FizzBuzz) diffs to look at. Next time :)

Test cases implemented from 1 to 30, and if you run it, you will get outputs from 1 to 100.

Not bad for my third rust program, after Hello world and hello cargo :)
